# PigGame
Classic pig game, came out pretty well.

# Description

Players take turns to roll a single dice as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total
but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1. This was probably one of the hardest or just time
consuming projects I started out with. Although it was worth it because I actually had fun playing this when it was
done with some family members. Overall im very happy with the design and how it came out.
